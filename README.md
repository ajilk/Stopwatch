## Stopwatch
Designed to time Rubik's Cube Solves <br />

# To run the program

Clone and run make <br/>
The run it by typing ./stopwatch <br/>
And press Q to end program

# Features
 - Offers Visual Fonts which can be interchanged through a file (that fits the requirement) with ease <br/>
 - Displays previous 30 solve times along with statistics about it <br/>
 - Ability to remove last solve time <br/>

# Observations
This was a fun project to work on since it involved timing and visual effects involved.
However, I personally did not like the way the project was constructed. Since, I was getting
new ideas as I was programming it, I tried implementing those new feature without putting too 
much though to it. This lead to unclear code which could have been avoided if more thought was
put into it. Refactoring the project would definitly worth it in this case.
