Designed to time Rubik's Cube Solves <br />
<br/> <br/> <img src="demo.gif" width="400" /> <br/> <br/>
### How to Play
`make` and run it by typing `./stopwatch` <br/>
To start/stop the stopwatch: `press any key` <br/>
To remove last solve: `x or X` <br/>
To quit program: `q or Q` <br/>

### Features
 - Offers Visual Fonts which can be interchanged through a file (that fits the requirement) with ease <br/>
 - Displays previous 30 solve times along with statistics about it <br/>
 - Ability to remove last solve time <br/>

### Observations
This was a fun project to work on since it involved timing and visual effects.
However, I personally did not like the way the project was constructed. Since, I was getting
new ideas as I was programming it, I tried implementing those new feature without putting too 
much though to it. This lead to unclear code which could have been avoided if more thought was
put into it. Refactoring the project would definitely be worth it in this case.
